        <title>Festival at Nirman&#39;s Village</title>
        <description>Yesterday we went to a festival at our good friend Nirman and Saru’s village. They had been talking about this festival since the time we arrived here a month ago, so there was no way we were not going. 
Upon arriving at the village center, we could immediately tell that something special was about to happen. People filled every nook and corner of the square, and faces poked out of every window. This was a village festival held annually, a tradition of around 600 years where the village priests swam in the usually restricted pool of holy water. The priests wore a white robe for life, and were prohibited from doing certain things like cutting your hair and eating meat. Because the position of a priest was handed down by bloodline, you could only become priest when your father passed on. Therefore the priests were all pretty much at a ripe old age. And these priests had to swim in the pool of water with their robes, which apparently was extremely heavy even before being soaked in water. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pool.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:440px; height:590px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
One by one the priests in their white robes and emerged, marching in one line toward the water. You could tell that every pair of eyes were focused on the man at the front of the line, the priest who was first going to step into the pool. No one wanted to miss that defining moment when his fingertips would touch the water. Even I felt myself holding my breath. After a couple of times touching the water and sprinkling on his body, he plunged in, head first. Cheers erupted from every corner.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/priest.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:440px; height:590px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
Then one by one the priests came down, each time accompanied by wild gasps and cheers of joy. Towards the end, an especially frail looking old man came down supported by two men. Looking at the way he was covered with wrinkles and his body looking so fragile, I didn’t think he would be able to make it into the water. Neither did the two men supporting him. But despite the protests from the two men, the old priest pushed them off and into the water he went. The younger men obviously looked distressed, but unable to chase him into the water because non-priests were only able to enter the water after the priests finished swimming. The festival could sometimes be dangerous, with the older people with weak immune systems exerting their body at such lengths. The old man’s action displayed just how special this event was to them, and not even their physical condition could stop them from diving in.

Once everything was complete it was time for the local people (only men though) to jump into the pool. It went absolutely wild with young men diving in from every corner. Look at Nirman go!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jumping.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:330px; height:440px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It was a nice refreshing time full of colors, music and fresh unpolluted air of the village. I later heard that this festival might come to an end in the future, as villagers were beginning to protest against the priest’s prestige and the benefits they were receiving. This was because the younger priests were not abiding by some of the rules, like not wearing the white robe at all times or wearing underwear. This made me think about what culture and tradition really meant. Culture and tradition is not something that is completely stagnant over time. But change that comes blatantly would never be accepted as part of it. Personally it would be a little sad to see the tradition of the festival that embodied such unity and spirituality lost, in exchange for preserving tradition as people knew it. In a country where culture and tradition is so closely intertwined with daily life, it would be interesting to see how they can be adapted to modern day society, and where people will strictly put their foot down to draw the line.

        <title>A Visit to CloudFactory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s probably not a single person in Kathmandu interested in IT that doesn’t know CloudFactory. CloudFactory is one of the major international IT companies here in Kathmandu, and not only are they well known inside the country, but they are well recognized abroad too for their social mission. CloudFactory basically provides BPO (business process outsourcing) services through an API driven on-demand workforce. So what happens is, when foreign clients (businesses) hands them over their back end work, the parts that can be automated will be processed through tools that internal software developers developed, and the rest are divided into small micro tasks to be done manually. What’s cool about this is that these micro tasks like data entry are delegated to people all around Kathmandu - people who may not necessarily have high IT skills but are ready to work with their computers. CloudFactory has been able to provide employment to thousands of youth this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our encounter with CloudFactory is kind of a funny story actually. Last year when we first came up with the concept of TECHRISE, we did a simple google search “Ruby on Rails Nepal”. It seemed like this CloudFactory was the dominant, if not only, company using Rails. And this mega company seemed to have evolved from the same idea that we had – teaching Ruby on Rails to local Nepalese. When we clicked around the homepage some more, we saw that the head office was located in Durham – which was ten minutes away from where Take was studying at in North Carolina (We were both studying abroad in the US at the time). It felt like fate. We knew we had to go talk to them. So a couple of weeks later, we had our meeting set up at their office in a super cool startup hub complete with a slide. They were really nice cool guys, introduced us to Karmath the alpha of the Nepal operations, and fast forward to today we were meeting up with him and the CloudFactory team at their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of our visit to CloudFactory today was to talk about the possible collaboration that we could have between CloudFactory and TECHRISE. Our first visit to CloudFactory – we were absolutely blown away. From the outside you couldn’t tell but the inside, it was buzzing with energy. Rows of wooden desks, multiple desktops and macs lying around, loads of mug cups…it looked like a startup you would see in the US. I immediately envisioned TECHRISE becoming like this giant operation. &lt;i&gt;The dream&lt;/i&gt;.
We had a great meeting on the rooftop with the developers that Karmath brought together. They were super nice, and offered to help us in things like looking over our curriculum and providing mentorship for the more advanced student later on. It was super exciting to think about the prospects of collaborating with a company like CloudFactory. We left the office in awe, and hopes that one-day we could be as large and vibrant as they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cloudfactory.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cloud Factory Vist&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we returned we celebrated our team member Lakshman’s birthday! Lakshman has been amazing with all the marketing stuff  - reaching out to local media outlets, organizing events, pumping out blog content. There’s little detail that he misses, and is always there to remind us that there are gaps in our marketing schemes. The major reason why we have been gaining so much attention from around Kathmandu is definitely because of he’s doing. Even though we spend time together everyday, this was the first time we had some personal down time over some drinks. It was a lot of fun on the rooftop, as we just ate, drank and talked about the future of TECHRISE. Happy Birthday Lakshman!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I learned So Far About Starting Up a Startup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What I learned about starting up a start up – week three in progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four things I figured out about starting a start up in a foreign developing country so far. We’re only starting out so I’m sure I’ll be adding on to this later on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1.What you learn in books or in class means nothing!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ok, I take that back. Yes it’s always important to dig deep into books, podcasts, attend seminars and so forth to gain some basic knowledge on how to run a business. But the truth is, that knowledge will only take you so far, and you never will &lt;i&gt;really get it&lt;/i&gt; until you began. And when you are in a foreign country, you’ll probably diverge more than ever from what you studied because what ultimately matters is the local context. You can recite all the business terms and concepts in the world, but those aren’t the words used here in Nepal. &lt;i&gt;Nothing will work&lt;/i&gt; unless you adapt it to the way it’s done in this country. 
For example the day before we officially opened TECHRISE, we were having a cup of tea with our Nepali friends. They completely drilled us that evening and we realized that we knew nothing about Nepali style management. From how to deal with absences, tardiness, various holidays (some festival related holidays could lead up to weeks where people go back to their homes outside Kathmandu Valley), to the type of bonuses and incentives to keep everyone’s motivation high – they made us realize that &lt;i&gt;we had no clue&lt;/i&gt; about how things were done here. We went back to our rooms, re-assessed everything and drafted out some rules we wanted to make clear. I imagine that we would have had a far more chaotic organization if we hadn’t done this. You can have some pre-conceived notions about how things should be done, but you would be surprised at how things actually work. I would say make your assumptions and base your decisions off the theories and best practices you learned, but when you do, do the way the locals do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2.Build relationships, don’t just throw money at the problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will take you far are the people around you. It makes sense to have a good relationship with your employees and everyone else directly related to your business, but what about those that aren’t? - Just build a good relationship. Because problems like your pipe leaking, or your light suddenly going out are problems that are going to keep coming back. In a society where everything is so tight knit and communal, the way to get things done is to “call a guy”. Or a guy who knows a guy. So try to build a good relationship with whomever you interact with, whether they may seem to be relevant to your business or not. Don’t just try to close the deal with money, because most likely you will be encountering them again and again. Even when you buy your fruits or veggies from the local market, get to know them. Once you’re on good terms with them, they will reduce the price of your merchandise or sometimes give you a little something extra. It can be small little things like this, but it will definitely eliminate your daily stress and brighten up your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3.The concept of time is radically different from yours&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think startup, you may imagince the team working blood and sweat around the clock. Every second matters, and the success of your business depends on the time you devote to it. We feel the exact same way sometimes, and want to just keep working. BUT we know that it’s almost as equally important to have our daily evening tea with our friends who come by after work. The &lt;i&gt;hanging out&lt;/i&gt; part is crucial, because to them the time spent together (not necessarily doing anything) is valuable, and that’s what you do if you trust and love each other. Another thing is that Nepali time is usually around 15 ~30 minutes later than the normal time on the clock, or even later sometimes. Totally different from Japan where we are strictly taught to be at least five minutes earlier than scheduled time. So, creating a culture of time management is super high on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4.Listen – no, really&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think you know better just because you went to some elite school, did some internships and took a class or two about business. Because you don’t. You will gain much more insights and will be able to make better decisions if you actually took the time to listen. Like I said above, you really want to adapt your marketing strategies, operations and all to be effective and appealing to the local people. You need to understand how people here react to certain messages and actions from the company. For example when we first opened up applications to enroll in TECHRISE in January, by the next day almost 40 people had signed up. Concerned that we wouldn’t be able to handle so many students in the beginning, I hastily decided to close down the application form. But later my team members urged me to keep them open longer, because their intuition told them that while many would be interested in this new foreign program, they were unlikely to actually complete the pre-work (necessary for admittance). True enough, out of the hundred that signed up only eight ended up completing the pre-work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a summary of what i’ve learned so far. Hope there were some things that you found interesting or could relate to! Let me know if you liked this post or not :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World!</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;hello-world&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it&#39;s kind of tacky but since we are starting up a web dev related startup, I decided to use the most commonly used line ever for novice coders - Hello World. So, Hello World. I’ve finally decided to start my own blog about my daily doings and findings here in Nepal. It’s been a month since I started living here with my boyfriend Take, and everyday is really a new day. So much has happened, and things have been moving astonishingly fast with our startup TECHRISE. I hope this can be just a light read kind of blog where you can get a taste of the hustle-bustle life going on here. You can also check also out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techrise.me/blog&quot;&gt;TECHRISE Blog&lt;/a&gt; which is a little bit more on a serious note. Comments would be greatly appreciated - it would really be a source of motivation for me to keep on writing and exploring:) &lt;br /&gt;
Since we are already one-month in, i’m going to give a quick run down what went on so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Week:&lt;/strong&gt; Cleaning, buying, repairing — not everything, but A LOT. The carpet, tables, chairs, lights, fridge...wow, starting out a new life is costly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Week:&lt;/strong&gt; Painted some walls. Did more cleaning and moving things around. Would not have done it without all our friends (and friends of friends). One work, one cup of tea. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Third Week:&lt;/strong&gt; Officially launched TECHRISE on August 1st! Welcomed our first 8 students whom we selected from the pre work. Everyone is super excited, and some students are just raging through the course work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Week:&lt;/strong&gt; TECHRISE picking up..? First paying customers as well as new user signups breaking record each day. Also we are starting to follow the routine of sleeping by 10pm and waking up by 6:30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other stuff that happened&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things related to TECHRISE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We held our first public event “How to Start Your Freelancing Career”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were approached by a college out of the blue to speak at a conference and give training workshops at their college &lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;We were featured in a couple of Neplali magazine outlets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently our biggest competitor is viewing us as a threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pumping out work daily at the office with the four team members from one to five. Communication is mostly done via slack, even though we are sitting opposite from each other. Go home, continue communicating via slack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things not related to TECHRISE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We literally drank more than a hundred cups of tea each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went to two birthday parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went swimming in a local swimming pool (people spat a lot in it but it was still fun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went to a bar where they played metal and Nepali folk songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made Take dance, he was pretty bad &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a five minute conversation with the shop owner in Nepali, of which I understood about 60%. Progress! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
