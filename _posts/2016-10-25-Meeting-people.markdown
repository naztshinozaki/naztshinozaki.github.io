The weekend has been the most breakthrough weekend for us in terms of getting to know people. We were especially keen to meet the expat community becuase although we’ve been here three months now, we hadn’t gotten to know the foreigners like us residing in Nepal. We were just a 15 minute walk away from an area which was home to many expats, as well as entrepreneural communities and nonprofit organizations. 
<br>

*Take and I are moderate introverts*. We love talking and meeting new people, but once we put a hold on this flow, it’s pretty hard for us to get back on it. Especially with the past couple of months trying to get the product ready and interacting mostly with our students, meeting new people seemed like a looming hurdle in front of us. 
<br>

Never the less, we knew it was time to get out there and start getting to know the expat/entrepreneural community. Not only because I knew there were going to be a lot of people doing extremely cool stuff, but also because we definitely needed a fresh a pair of eyes on how we were operating TECHRISE. 
<br>

When I put a post up on the facebook page called the *Nepal Expat group*, about how I was interested in partnering up with individuals or organizations, I was surprised by the overwhelming responses I got. I immediately received multiple comments and direct messages. Everyone was super helpful, either saying that they wanted to talk to us personally, or referring us to other people that may be interested. 
<br>

So the couple of days were spent meeting these people over skype calls and over coffee. Every time we finished the conversation and walked out, we were all smiles. There were truly many *givers* here, **ready to impart their experience and knowledge** to newbies like us. One of the guys we met ran one of the very few co-working spaces in Nepal called *the Platform*. It was a bright, modern and looking space, furnished with custom-made wooden furniture. It was only open up to 5pm unfortunately, due to some restrictions over what businesses could be run at night – most of the town was asleep by 9pm.
<br>

On Friday evening we stepped into the Happy Hour at *Nepal Communitere*, a collaboration / maker space for post earthquake reconstruction initiatives. They held Mini-Maker Faire a couple of weeks back, showcasing the different hardware and technologies that were trying to address some existing challenges in the country. Unfortunately we missed this, but we always knew that the Nepal Communitere was up to really exciting things and I always wanted to check it out. 
At the Happy Hour, we made more friends (yay!). We met a young Nepali women entrepreneur creating water filter technologies that were distributed to more than 10,000 people last year after the earthquake, as well as another women who was the head of the Nepali Innovation Lab, which was a hub for various post-earthquake innovations. 
<br>

These people we met over the days, many of them who left their hometowns to spend months or years here in Nepal, taking action in hope to make positive change, were really a respectable group. Challenges that came their way, especially because they were foreign, were something they had to overcome continuously, and we saw they did it with good spirit. **Realizing that they had all run up against similar problems, struggled through the same dilemmas, I felt like I could go forward with more confidence**. 
<br>

The people whom you hang around with definitely influences your attitudes and actions. **One way to prevent any unproductive burn out feeling that may come in the future, I think would be to intentionally surround yourself with these kinds of people**. The positive energy, and helping hands of the people whom we met, definitely brought to us a fresh start to a new week.
